<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Type here: berif description of the lab

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26.To encrypt a message, each block of n letters (considered as an n-component vector) is multiplied by an invertible n Ã— n matrix, against modulus 26. To decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the matrix used for encryption.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>
