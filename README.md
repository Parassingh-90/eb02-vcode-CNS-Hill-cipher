<b> Experiment|     <b> 2.Write a Java Program to perform Encryption and Decryption using  Hill Cipher
<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The objective of this lab is that student must able to know encryption and decryption process to secure message using Hill Cipher 

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

<div align="justify">Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26.To encrypt a message, each block of n letters (considered as an n-component vector) is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26. To decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the matrix used for encryption.</div>

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>
