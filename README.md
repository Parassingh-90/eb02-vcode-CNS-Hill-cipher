<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

<div align="justify">Hill cipher use polygraphic substitution technique to substitute the given letter or character. In hill cipher method each letter or character is represented by a number like A=0,B=1,C=2...Z=25.In this method (hill cipher) take module 26 to encrypt a message.Each block of n letters is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix(in this 2X2 matrix is taken for key value) , against modulus 26. To decrypt the ciphertext (message), again perform multiplication of each block by the inverse of the matrix used in encryption process.</div>
