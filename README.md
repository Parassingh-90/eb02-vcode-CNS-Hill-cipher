<b> Experiment|     <b> 1.Write a Java Program to perform Encryption and Decryption using  Hill Cipher
<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The objective of this lab is that student must able to know encryption and decryption process to secure message using Hill Cipher 

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26.To encrypt a message, each block of n letters (considered as an n-component vector) is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26. To decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the matrix used for encryption.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

B.TECH(CS/IT)

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

This experiment is alligned with an introductory course on Cryptography
