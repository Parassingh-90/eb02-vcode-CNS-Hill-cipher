1)User has to provide the key matrix in the text box provided in the first pane of the simulator.
2)Click on the “Submit” button. It takes you to second form in which you have to enter plaintext.
3)Click on “ Submit“ button.Then two "Next" and "Reset"buttons appears in the first pane.
4)Click on “next “button. It provides the logical explanation of the output i.e. how the cipher text coressponding to entered plain text is being calculated.
5)Click on “Next” button. The cipher text is displayed as output in the third pane, with the end of logical explanation of encryption.
6)Click on “Next” button.Two "Yes" and "No" buttons appears in the first pane from where user has to chosse whether he want to go for decryption or not.
7)If user click on "Yes".It provides the plain text corresponding to generated cipher text with the end of logical explaination of decryption and user can use “Reset” button to demonstrate hill cipher for another inputs.
8) If user click on "No"."Reset" button will appear in the the first pane which can be used by the user to demonstrate hill cipher for another inputs.
9)User can use “Reset” button to demonstrate hill cipher for another inputs .
