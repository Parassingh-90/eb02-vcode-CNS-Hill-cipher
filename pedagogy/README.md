#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
<div align="justify">User input key and plaintext(message).Break the key into nxn matrix.Based on key matrix plaintext is divided into chunks.After that perform encryption using key matrix and message chunk matrix to generate ciphertext.To decrypt the ciphertext find inverse of key matrix and perform matrix multiplication with ciphertext.</div>
